### this program should:
###     *take a list of words
###     *make a list of possible IPA vowels
###     *find the index of the first IPA vowel
###     *cut off everthing before the first vowel
###
### this will make only strict rhymes. future functionality could be to have a switch to allow loose rhymes as well
